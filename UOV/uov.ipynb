    "## Issues & Notes for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 1: Missing variable `n` in `Sign()`\n",
    "**Problem**: The `Sign()` function uses `V = random_matrix(F_q, 1, n-m)` but `n` is never defined as a local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Add at the beginning of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 2: Unused variable in `Check_Oil()`\n",
    "**Problem**: The line `v_random = sum(F_q.random_element()*O_bar.transpose()[i] for i in range(o))` computes a random vector but never uses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: This line can be removed entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 3: Inconsistent naming in `Sign()`\n",
    "**Problem**: \n",
    "- Variable `V` is actually a 1×(n-m) matrix, not a vector\n",
    "- Some other variables names\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Renaming for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 4: No maximum iteration limit in `Sign()`\n",
    "**Problem**: If the matrix L keeps being singular, the function loops indefinitely (though statistically extremely unlikely with proper parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Add a safety limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 5: No input validation in `Verify()`\n",
    "**Problem**: The function assumes correct input dimensions without checking. Wrong sized inputs could cause cryptic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**: Add validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 6: Three redundant public key formats\n",
    "**Problem**: `Get_UOV_Keys()` returns three versions (P, Public_key, Public_key_polar) which is confusing:\n",
    "- `Sign()` uses `P` (decomposed form [P1, P2, P3])\n",
    "- `Verify()` uses `Public_key` (full block form)\n",
    "- `Public_key_polar` is never used in provided code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clarification**: These exist for flexibility:\n",
    "- **P**: Decomposed form [P1, P2, P3] most efficient for signing operations\n",
    "- **Public_key**: Full block matrix form-direct representation for verification\n",
    "- **Public_key_polar**: Symmetric form M + M^T-numerically cleaner for polynomial evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider documenting which form should be used when, or simplifying to return only what's needed for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 7: `Upper()` function purpose not leveraged\n",
    "**Problem**: The `Upper()` function creates a canonical upper-triangular form, but this property isn't explicitly used in signing/verification for consistency checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This is mathematically fine, the math still works correctly even without explicit use. However, it's worth understanding that both `Public_key` and `Public_key_polar` implicitly maintain the upper triangular structure that was enforced during key generation.\n",

    "## 1. Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's improve this implementation, starting with hashing the message, as in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Hash_Message()` function** - Uses SHAKE-256 to hash the message + salt into a vector in F_q^m. It converts the hash bytes to field elements modulo q.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Salt handling** - Sign now accepts an optional salt parameter. If not provided, generates a random 16-byte salt. Returns both signature and salt together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Updated Sign()** - Now takes the actual message string instead of pre-hashed t_document. Computes the hash internally. Also returns the number of attempts for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Updated Verify()** - Takes the message string and extracts salt from the signature tuple. Recomputes the hash and checks it matches the evaluation of the signature under the public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Simplified key generation** - Removed the unused `Public_key_polar` return and the redundant P storage since Sign uses the precomputed S matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Example usage at bottom** - Shows how to sign a message and verify it works, plus a negative test showing wrong messages fail verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cryptographic security now comes from the hash function making it hard to forge signatures for arbitrary messages."

    "### Attack 1: Direct Attack (Solving MQ Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Direct Attack** is the most fundamental attack against any multivariate cryptosystem. It treats the UOV public key as a generic system of multivariate quadratic equations and attempts to solve it directly without exploiting any special structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation:**\n",
    "- The public key is a system of `m` quadratic equations in `n` variables: `P(s) = t`\n",
    "- Each equation has approximately `n(n+1)/2` quadratic terms\n",
    "- The problem is to find `s ∈ F_q^n` such that all `m` equations are satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is hard:**\n",
    "- The MQ problem is proven NP-hard over finite fields\n",
    "- For random systems, the best known algorithms have exponential complexity\n",
    "- The complexity grows with both `n` (number of variables) and `q` (field size)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attack Methods:**\n",
    "1. **Brute Force**: Try all `q^n` possible vectors (infeasible for proper parameters)\n",
    "2. **Groebner Basis**: Algorithms like F4/F5 that solve polynomial systems\n",
    "3. **XL Algorithm**: Extended linearization approach\n",
    "4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine exhaustive search with algebraic solving\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why UOV resists this attack:**\n",
    "- Parameters are chosen so that `q^n` is exponentially large (e.g., `256^112 ≈ 2^896`)\n",
    "- The quadratic structure makes Groebner basis computation infeasible\n",
    "- Even with the unbalanced structure, solving remains hard when `n > 2m`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Parameter Dependence:**\n",
    "- Primary security comes from `n` and `q`\n",
    "- The ratio `n/m` affects complexity but doesn't create polynomial-time attacks\n",
    "- Field size `q` impacts both brute force and algebraic attacks"
