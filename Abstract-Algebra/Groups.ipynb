    "# 1. Cycle Notation for Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "In abstract algebra, especially when working with symmetric groups, permutations are often represented using **cycle notation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Cycle Notation?\n",
    "A permutation is a rearrangement of elements. Cycle notation expresses how elements are permuted by grouping them into cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the cycle $(1\\ 2\\ 3)$ means:\n",
    "- $1 \\to 2$\n",
    "- $2 \\to 3$\n",
    "- $3 \\to 1$\n",
    "All other elements (not listed) are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Read Cycle Notation\n",
    "- $(1\\ 2)$ swaps $1$ and $2$, leaving other elements unchanged.\n",
    "- $(1\\ 2\\ 3)$ sends $1$ to $2$, $2$ to $3$, and $3$ to $1$.\n",
    "- The identity permutation is denoted by $()$ or sometimes by $e$, meaning every element is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Cycles\n",
    "If a permutation consists of more than one cycle, cycles are written side by side, e.g., $(1\\ 2)(3\\ 4)$ means $1 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 1$, $3 \\to 4$, $4 \\to 3$.\n",
    "These cycles are **disjoint** if they do not share any elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycle notation is compact and makes it easy to see the structure of permutations, especially in symmetric groups like $S_n$."
