# Advanced Topics in Cryptography

### Description  
This repository documents my learning path from the foundations of **abstract algebra** (groups, rings, fields, ideals, finite fields, etc.) to their applications in **modern cryptography**. The project starts with study notes and solved exercises (mainly inspired by *Gallian*) and gradually moves toward cryptographic constructions, with a special focus on **multivariate public key cryptography** (e.g., UOV and MAYO).  

The repo is designed as:  
- A **study companion**: clear notes and proofs.  
- A **problem collection**: selected exercises and sketches of solutions.  
- A **code lab**: experiments in Python/SageMath with algebraic structures (groups, rings, finite fields, polynomials) and cryptographic primitives.

### Structure (planned)
- `abstract-algebra/`  
  Notes and exercises on groups, rings, ideals, fields, and polynomial rings.  

- `cryptography/`  
  Implementations and experiments with algebraic cryptosystems. First focus: **multivariate schemes (UOV, MAYO)**.

### Goals
- Build solid algebra foundations to understand why cryptographic schemes work.  
- Connect the theory with **practical code experiments**.  
- Collect a set of worked examples and exercises for future reference.
